Read this short tutorial on installing forms: http://github.com/EliotVU/Forms/wiki/Installing-Forms
Once installed, start by making your first menu: http://github.com/EliotVU/Forms/wiki/Your-First-Menu

Testing
=====
There will come a time you will need to fix the positions of your components with visual help, this can be done if you build Forms in debug mode.

Make a shortcut to your game if you haven't got one yet. Add the parameter -debug and -wxwindows.

Then launch your game through the shortcut, and hit alt+enter to go windowed mode. 

Hold Shift and CTRL, and click on the component you wish to modify, this will popup a dialog with all the options you wish to edit, when done copy those settings to your code.
